# Munny

A simple android app that does nothing important. Written 100% in Kotlin.

The app is created to assist me personally working on Kotlin/Android project as it
contain best practices, insults, jokes, and fan girling comments. It also uses popular Android
libraries such as OkHttp, Retrofit, Picasso, Glade, etc and probably popular libraries that written
in/for Kotlin in the future.
